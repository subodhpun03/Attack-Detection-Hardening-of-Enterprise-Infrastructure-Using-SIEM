# Attack-Detection-Hardening-of-Enterprise-Infrastructure-Using-SIEM

📌 Project Overview

      This project demonstrates a real-world enterprise security workflow where cyberattacks are simulated, detected, analyzed, and mitigated using a SIEM solution. The lab follows a complete Red Team → Blue Team → Hardening approach to showcase how modern organizations monitor and secure their infrastructure.
      
      The project is built around Wazuh SIEM and multiple virtual machines to generate logs, perform attacks, detect malicious activity, and apply system hardening.
